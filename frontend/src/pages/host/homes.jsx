              <p>
                No matter what kind of home or room you have to share, Airbnb
                makes it simple and secure to host travellers. Youâ€™re in full
                control of your availability, prices, house rules, and how you
                interact with guests.

                To keep you, your home, and your belongings safe, we cover every
