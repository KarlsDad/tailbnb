    "hostDescription": "Just to write few lines about who i am:-) Since 2002 that i decided to live in Bali until now, i work on the fashion industry as a women's footwear designer and manufacturer...Lucky me;-) Well, i actually studied architectural design at first and that was the reason that brought me to Bali in 1999.I have been offered a scholarship from the Indonesian government back then about which i am still thankful, because that one year stay opened many new venues for me and brought me in contact with such a different,artistic,inspirational and rich culture that helped me a lot in what i did afterwards. Between 2000 and 2002 i lived in U.S were i had 2 Indonesian furniture and interior design Galleries and at the same time i started being involved in designing women's shoes mostly as a passion than a way of living...Even though i had a beautiful business that was every day growing in U.S, my spirit was non stop dreaming of Bali. End of 2002 i decided to finally follow my heart and move on to my dream island. I was very right:-) Here i could have what i was searching for.Sun,Smiles,Sea,Spas,Spirituality and amazing nature all around the island:-):-) Straight i met my beloved husband with whom we are together since then and we have a wonferful 7 years old daughter and a baby boy . As for my business, i focused on my passion for designing shoes that was in deed very creative... Several years later my architectural soul woke up again. I challenged myself into turning the inspirational footwear studio of all those years ,from an old basic small home, into a villa.That's how villa Samadhi was born. It took 9 months of constant work and total reconstruction to achieve the result of the present villa . I put all the love and energy i had and together with a small team of guys , that were very understanding , we tried to keep a balance of not too modern ,chill out, tropical estate for the guest to feel relaxed and at home... I hope you will love it as much as i do:-) Your feed back is valuable:-)",

    "space": "Akureyri is just 10 min. drive. In Akureyri you have all kinds of shops, restaurantsand many cafés, different galleries and there are lots of professional music concerts as well all summer music festival. In the apartment is a living area with sofa, Tv, dining table and fully equipped kitchen. On the first floor is a bathroom and one bedroom with bunk bed.

In winter, ski or do cross-country skiing in the best ski resort with view of the fjord, amazing! Or dog sledging with our huskies and snowshoe walks or fishing through ice. And then it is very popular to drive the road skirting the beautiful western shore of the Eyjafjordur Fjord, visit the magnificent waterfalls, Goðafoss and Dettifoss, Dimmuborgir, Mývatn, the Grand Canyon of Jökulsárgljúfur and whale watching in Húsavík. It is also possible to take an organised day trip from Akureyri to the island of Grimsey, which straddles the Arctic Circle. It is easy to get to Akureyri! Icelandair is offering flights to Akureyri. So it is as well just a 45 Min. flight from Reykjavik downtown to Akureyri. It is only a 7km drive from the airport to our house. If you are driving, Akureyri is on the ring road and is approx. 5 to 6 hours drive from Reykjavik. To stay in vaðlaheiði you need a car. The property offers a quiet position and a great view.

I traded Canada (Edmonton) for Cancun when I was 25 because I had a desire to never have to return to reality . It works ,we don’t count down to vacation anymore and board 20+ planes internationally each year to see new “ panorámicas” So we understand and are sympathetic to your stress and expectations . Our condominium property is out of our control so we often have to work much harder to ensure guests happiness but I’m almost always touched by the reviews . The rare time there is a negative aspect in a review I spring to action to change or even totally remodel the area in order to prevent it from happening again. For 15 years I worked in all the top luxury hotels as concierge / guest services and I learned many things that can help you have a fabulous experience. I'm here full time, not an absentee owner.

More about myself and my art is located at magentaRaven and you know the rest... The desert is one of my favorite places.
